%description
Stateful programmatic web browsing, after Andy Lester's Perl module
WWW::Mechanize.

The library is layered:	mechanize.Browser (stateful web browser),
mechanize.UserAgent (configurable URL opener), plus urllib2 handlers.

Features include: ftp:, http: and file: URL schemes, browser history,
high-level hyperlink and HTML form support, HTTP cookies, HTTP-EQUIV and
Refresh, Referer [sic] header, robots.txt, redirections, proxies, and
Basic and Digest HTTP authentication.  mechanize's response objects are
(lazily-) .seek()able and still work after .close().

Much of the code originally derived from Perl code by Gisle Aas
(libwww-perl), Johnny Lee (MSIE Cookie support) and last but not least
Andy Lester (WWW::Mechanize).  urllib2 was written by Jeremy Hylton.
